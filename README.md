The aim of this analysis is to understand what influences people to buy bikes. We looked at how different demographic and socio-economic factors affect bike buying behaviour. These factors include gender, marital status, income range, number of children, education level, occupation, number of cars, home ownership, commute distance, region, age, age group, and the number of bikes purchased.

Number of Bikes Purchased: Total number of bikes bought

Methodology

To analyse the data, we used descriptive statistics to summarise the dataset and identify patterns. Visualisations, such as bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots, were used to illustrate the relationships between different variables and bike purchases. For a deeper understanding, regression analysis was conducted to determine the impact of each factor on the likelihood of purchasing bikes.

Steps Involved:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The dataset underwent thorough cleaning and preprocessing within Excel to ensure data quality and consistency.

Pivot Tables and Charts: Utilizing Excel's pivot tables and charting features, we've created visualizations to uncover trends and insights related to different aspects of the dataset.
Visualisation: Creating charts to visualise the distribution and relationships between variables using pivot chart and tables 

Results
Key Findings:

1. Total Number of Customers :The analysis reveals that overall, there were more male customers than female customers across all regions. Specifically, the grand total shows that out of 990 customers, 507 were male and 483 were female.
2. Bike Purchases by Gender : The analysis indicates that in terms of bike purchases, males bought slightly more bikes than females. Specifically, out of a grand total of 479 bikes purchased, 242 were bought by males and 237 were bought by females.
3. Bike Purchases by Marital Status : The analysis shows that among different marital statuses, single individuals made slightly more bike purchases compared to married individuals. Specifically, out of the total of 479 bikes purchased, 250 were bought by single individuals, while 229 were bought by married individuals.
4. Bike Purchases by Region : The analysis reveals that among different regions, North America had the highest number of bike purchases, followed by Europe and then the Pacific region. Specifically, out of the grand total of 479 bikes purchased, 219 were bought in North America, 147 in Europe, and 113 in the Pacific region.
5. Car Ownership Analysis : The car ownership analysis indicates that among customers who did not purchase a bike, the majority owned one car, followed by two cars. Conversely, among customers who did purchase a bike, those who owned two cars made the most purchases. Specifically, out of the grand total of 990 customers, 511 did not purchase a bike, while 479 did.
6. Income Analysis: The income analysis shows that the majority of bike purchases were made by individuals with an income range of $10,000 to $50,000, followed by those with an income range of $50,000 to $100,000. Conversely, individuals with an income range of $100,000 to $200,000 made the fewest purchases. Specifically, out of the grand total of 479 bike purchases, 223 were made by individuals with an income range of $10,000 to $50,000, 217 by those with an income range of $50,000 to $100,000, and 39 by those with an income range of $100,000 to $200,000.
7. Age Group Analysis: In the age group analysis, it's observed that middle-aged adults made the highest number of bike purchases, followed by adults and seniors. Additionally, more males than females purchased bikes across all age groups. Specifically, out of the grand total of 479 bike purchases, 144 were made by middle-aged adults, 179 by adults, and 121 by seniors.

Conclusion
   
After analysing the bike purchases dataset, we found some important patterns in customer behaviour. Overall, there were slightly more male customers than female ones, and single people tended to buy bikes slightly more often than married individuals. North America was the top region for bike purchases, followed by Europe and the Pacific. Among those who didn't buy bikes, most owned just one car, while those who did buy bikes tended to own two cars the most. Most bike purchases were made by people earning between $10,000 and $50,000, and middle-aged adults were the most active bike buyers across all age groups.
